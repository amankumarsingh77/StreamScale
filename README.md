## <a name="features">üîã Features</a>

üëâ **Register **: Users can sign up to get access to the dashboard.

üëâ **Upload Video Files**: Users can upload videos that will then be transcoded.

üëâ **Update Profile**: Users can update their profile details.

üëâ **User Authorization**: As transcoding a video is a costly process only a few people are allowed to use the app as of now (Will shift to subscription-based soon).

üëâ **File Upload Using AWS S3**: Users can upload the video files which will initially stored on AWS S3.

üëâ **Transcode A Video**: A transcoding task starts as soon as a user uploads the video and does all the required processes to make it work.

üëâ **Dashboard**: Authorized users can upload and view the details (name, status, size) of the videos.

üëâ **Video Player**: After the video is transcoded the user can play the videos in the browser itself.

**New features will added in future**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

Here are some prerequisites that are required to run this project:
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account.
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) Account with updated billing information (You can skip this if you want to use s3 as your primary storage).
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and a [Redis](https://upstash.com/) database URL (Ignore if deploying locally).

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amankumarsingh77/StreamScale.git
cd healthcare
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

**Client**

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Server**

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Worker**

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
#aws credentials 

  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
  AWS_REGION=
  AWS_CLUSTER_ARN=
  AWS_TASK_ARN=
  AWS_QUEUE_URL=
  SUBNET1=
  SUBNET2=
  SUBNET3=
  SECURITY_GROUP_ID=
  AWS_S3_BUCKET=

  #cloudflare r2 credentials

  R2_BUCKET=
  R2_REGION=
  R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
  R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
  R2_ENDPOINT=
  CLOUDFLARE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=

  #redis credentials

  UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=
  UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=
  
  #mongodb credentials

  MONGO_URI=

  #others

  MAX_RUNNING_TASKS=
  SECRET_KEY=
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Appwrite credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up on the [Appwrite website](https://appwrite.io/).

**Running the Project**

**Client**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Server**
```bash
node server.js
```
